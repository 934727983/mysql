# Cost effective and esay to use

It features cost-effectiveness, flexible billing, on-demand configuration changes, easy deployment, high compatibility, and simple operations and maintenance \(O&M\).

## Cost effectiveness

The price of ApsaraDB RDS is one third that of databases built based on ECS instances and one tenth that of databases built based on servers that you purchase.

## Flexible billing

ApsaraDB RDS supports the subscription and pay-as-you-go billing methods. You can flexibly choose a billing method based on your business requirements to reduce costs.

-   For short-term use, we recommend that you choose the pay-as-you-go billing method. A pay-as-you-go instance is charged per hour based on your actual resource usage. If you no longer need your pay-as-you-go instance, you can release it to reduce costs.
-   For long-term use, we recommend that you choose the subscription billing method. You can receive larger discounts for longer subscription periods.

For more information, see [Billing methods](/intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/Pricing, billable items, and billing methods.md).

## On-demand configuration changes

You can purchase an RDS instance with low specifications that can meet your business requirements As the database workloads and data storage increase, you can upgrade the instance specifications. If your business scale becomes small again, you can downgrade the instance specifications to reduce costs.

For more information, see [Change the specifications of an ApsaraDB RDS instance]() and [Specification change fees](/intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/Specification change fees.md).

## Easy deployment

-   You do not need to purchase database server hardware or software. This significantly reduces costs.
-   You can create an RDS instance of required specifications within a few minutes in the [ApsaraDB RDS console](https://rdsnext.console.aliyun.com) by calling an [API operation](/intl.en-US/API Reference/API overview.md).

## High compatibility

-   You can use ApsaraDB RDS databases in the same way as databases that run native engines. This relieves the need to acquire new knowledge.
-   ApsaraDB RDS is compatible with existing programs and tools. You can use [Data Transmission Service \(DTS\)]() to quickly migrate data to ApsaraDB RDS. You can also use common data import and export tools to migrate data. The data migration does not require much workforce.
