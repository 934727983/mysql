## Causes {#section_svt_el8_gt0 .section}

Microsoft will end its support for SQL Server 2008 and 2008 R2 on July 9, 2019. This means that regular security updates will no longer be provided. However, you will be able to purchase up to three years of Extended Security Updates from Microsoft. Microsoft will offer Extended Security Updates for purchase on July 9, 2019, which includes Security Updates and Bulletins rated "critical."
