## Remote disaster recovery from a user-created database to an RDS instance {#section_qlq_vwz_s2b .section}

You can use DTS to synchronize the data of a database in any user-created data center or an ECS-hosted database in one region to an RDS instance in another region in real time. In such a case, you can always retrieve a backup of your data on Alibaba Cloud even if your data center is damaged.
