# Low costs and easy-to-use {#concept_n4d_tx5_tdb .concept}

## Flexible billing methods {#section_cfs_yeo_sx1 .section}

RDS provides flexible billing methods to help you save costs.

-   For short-term requirements, create Pay-As-You-Go instances \(billed by hour\), which can be released at any time to save costs.
-   For long-term requirements, create Subscription instances, which are more cost-effective. Furthermore, the longer the subscription, the higher the discount.

For more information, see [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_60/DNMYSQ1864174/EN-US\_TP\_7805.md\#section\_25l\_g7t\_kzx](../../../../intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/Billing methods and billing items.md#section_25l_g7t_kzx).

## Easy deployment {#section_kjc_jds_v68 .section}

-   You do not need to purchase database server hardware or software.
-   To use RDS, simply create RDS instances through the [RDS console](https://rdsnext.console.aliyun.com) or [API](../../../../intl.en-US/API Reference/Instance management/Create an RDS instance.md#). Instances are created within minutes.

## On-demand upgrades and downgrades {#section_tpf_vx5_tdb .section}

If you are starting a new business, you can buy an RDS instance of low specifications. As the database pressure and data volume increase, upgrade the instance specifications. During off-peak hours, you can downgrade the instance specifications to save costs. For more information, see [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_60/DNMYSQ1860058/EN-US\_TP\_7891.md\#](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Change configurations.md#) and [../../../../dita-oss-bucket/SP\_60/DNMYSQ1864174/EN-US\_TP\_7806.md\#](../../../../intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/Billing details about configuration change.md#).

## High compatibility {#section_vpc_804_xh3 .section}

-   You can operate RDS databases in the way you operate your own database engines.
-   RDS is compatible with your existing programs and tools. Commonly used data import and export tools can be used to import data to RDS. Furthermore, Alibaba Cloud provides [DTS](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/product/26590.htm) to simplify the migration.

## Simple O&M {#section_vpf_vx5_tdb .section}

-   Alibaba Cloud ensures the normal operation of RDS through routine maintenance and management, such as hardware/software fault processing and database patch upgrades.
-   You can also manage databases through the RDS console or API. Supported operations include instance management, database management, backup, recovery, and more.
