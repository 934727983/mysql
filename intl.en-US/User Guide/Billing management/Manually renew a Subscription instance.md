# Manually renew a Subscription instance {#concept_fwh_phj_wdb .concept}

If a Subscription instance expires and is not renewed in time, services wil be interrupted and data will be lost. For more information, see [Impact of expiration and overdue payment](../../../../intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/Impact of expiration and overdue payment.md#).

**Note:** Pay-As-You-Go instances do not have an expiration date and do not need to be renewed.

When a Subscription instance has not expired or within 15 days after it expires, you can manually renew the instance.

## Procedure {#section_plh_4jj_wdb .section}

1.  Log on to the [RDS console](https://rds.console.aliyun.com/).
2.  At the upper left corner, select the region where the target instance is located.
3.  Find the instance and click **Renew** in the **Action** column.
4.  Select the renewal period on the Renew page. The longer the renewal period, the higher the discount.
5.  Read the terms of service, select **Product Terms of Service and Service Level Notice and Terms of Use**, click **Pay Now**, and complete the payment.
