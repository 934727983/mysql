# Set the access mode {#concept_jlf_hpq_wdb .concept}

RDS supports two access modes: standard mode and safe connection mode. This article describes their differences and how to switch between them.

## Differences between standard mode and safe connection mode {#section_jf2_lqf_cfb .section}

-   **Standard mode \(recommended\)**: RDS uses [Sever Load Balancer](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/27539.htm) to eliminate the impact of database engine HA switching on the application layer. This shortens the response time and increases the performance.
-   **Safe connection mode \(database proxy mode\)**: This mode prevents 90% of disconnections, but increases the response time by 20% or more.

**Precautions**

-   If the network type of a SQL Server 2008 R2 instance is VPC, the access mode is safe connection mode and cannot be modified.
-   If the network type of a SQL Server 2008 R2 instance is classic network, the access mode is standard mode and cannot be modified.
