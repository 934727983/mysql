# Configure endpoints {#concept_tv3_pq1_ydb .concept}

RDS supports two types of endpoints: internal endpoints and public endpoints.

## Internal and endpoints {#section_8sw_rkp_hiw .section}

|Endpoint type|Description|
|-------------|-----------|
|Internal endpoints| -   An internal endpoint is generated by default.
-   If your application is deployed on an ECS instance that is located in the same region as your RDS instance and, at the same time, the ECS instance has the same [network type](intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Set network type.md) as your RDS instance, your RDS instance can communicate with the ECS instance through a private network. In such case, you do not need to apply for a public endpoint.
-   Accessing your RDS instance through a private network is more secure and helps to maximize RDS performance.

 |
|Public endpoints| -   You must manually apply for a public endpoint, which can be released at anytime.
-   If you cannot access your RDS instance through a private network in one of the following scenarios, you must apply for a public endpoint:
    -   You access your RDS instance from an ECS instance that is located in a different region or has a different [network type](intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Set network type.md) from your RDS instance.
    -   You access your RDS instance from a device outside the Alibaba Cloud.

 **Note:** 

-   Using the public endpoint reduces security. Please exercise caution.
-   To guarantee high security and performance, we recommend that you migrate your application to an ECS instance that is located in the same region and has the same network type as your RDS instance and then use the internal endpoint.

3.  Find the target RDS instance and click the instance ID.
4.  In the left-side navigation pane, click **Database Connection**.
5.  Apply for or release the public endpoint.

    **Note:** 

    -   The prefix of an endpoint starts with a lowercase letter and contains 8 to 64 characters including letters, digits, and hyphens \(-\).
    -   You cannot change the port of the internal or public endpoint for an RDS for SQL Server, RDS for PostgreSQL, or RDS for PPAS instance that runs in a VPC.
