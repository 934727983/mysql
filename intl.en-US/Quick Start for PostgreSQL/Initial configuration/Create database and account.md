# Create database and account {#concept_njz_1gg_wdb .concept}

s

Before using RDS, you must create databases and accounts for the RDS instance. For PostgreSQL instances, you must create an initial account on the RDS console, and then you can create and manage the databases through a client. This document takes the pgAdmin 4 client as an example to introduce how to create databases and accounts for PostgreSQL instances.

## Background information {#section_kcx_dgg_wdb .section}

-   Databases under a single instance share all the resources of this instance. Each PostgreSQL instance supports one initial account, countless general accounts, and countless databases. You must create and manage the general accounts and databases through SQL statements.
-   To migrate your local database to the RDS instance, you must create the same databases and accounts for the RDS instance as your local database.
-   When assigning account permissions for each database, follow the minimum permissionâ€™ principle and consider service roles to create accounts. Alternatively, rationally assign read-only and read/write permissions. When necessary, you can split accounts and databases into smaller units so that each account can only access data for its own services. If the account does not need to write data to a database, assign the read-only permission for the account.
-   For database security, set strong passwords for the accounts and change the passwords regularly.

## Procedure {#section_ixc_fgg_wdb .section}

    Parameters description:

    -   Host name/address: refers to the connection address of the RDS instance. If your application accesses the RDS instance through the intranet, enter the intranet IP address of the RDS instance. If your application accesses the RDS instance through the Internet, enter the Internet IP address of the RDS instance. You can view the connection address and port number as follows:
        1.  Log on to the [RDS console](https://rds.console.aliyun.com/).
        2.  Select the region where the target instance is located.
        3.  Click the ID of the instance to visit the Basic Information page.
        4.  View the intranet and Internet IP addresses and ports in the Basic Information area.
    -   Port: refers to the port number of the the RDS instance. If your application accesses the RDS instance through the intranet, enter the intranet port number of the RDS instance. If your application accesses the RDS instance through the Internet, enter the Internet port number of the RDS instance.
    -   Username: refers to the initial account name of the RDS instance.
    -   Password: refers to the password of the initial account of the RDS instance.
13. Click **Save**.
14. If the connection information is correct, select **Servers** \> **server name** \> **Databases** \> **postgres**. The following interface is displayed, which indicates that the connection to RDS instance is successful.

    **Note:** postgres is the default system database of the RDS instance. Do not do any operation in this database.
