# <@

This topic describes the <@ operator, which queries whether a grid is contained in a geometry.

## Syntax

```
boolean <@(geomgrid grid, geometry geom);
boolean <@(geometry geom, geomgrid grid);
boolean <@(geomgrid grid1, geomgrid grid2);
```

## Parameters

|Parameter|Description|
|:--------|:----------|
|grid|The grid whose spatial relationship you want to query.|
|geom|The geometry whose spatial relationship you want to query.|

## Description

This function returns the spatial relationship between a grid and a geometry. The geometry must use the CGC2000 spatial reference system. In addition, the spatial reference system identifier \(SRID\) of the geometry must be 4490.

## Examples

```
select ST_geomfromtext('POINT(116.31522216796875 39.910277777777778)',4490) <@
  ST_gridfromtext('G001331032213300013') as t;
