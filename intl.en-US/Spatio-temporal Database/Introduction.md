## Overview {#section_yvn_pc5_qfb .section}

Spatio-temporal data is graphic and image data that contains both space and time information. Spatio-temporal data consists of multidimensional information about objects, such as the location, shape, change, and size distribution. As a spatio-temporal engine, ApsaraDB PostgreSQL Ganos \(Ganos\) provides a series of data types, functions, and stored procedures for ApsaraDB for RDS to efficiently store, index, query, analyze, and compute spatio-temporal data.

This document describes how to use Ganos to manage and analyze spatio-temporal data.
