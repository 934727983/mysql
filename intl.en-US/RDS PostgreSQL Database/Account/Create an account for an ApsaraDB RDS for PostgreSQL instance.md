# Create an account for an ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instance

This topic describes how to create an account for an ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instance.

## Account types

ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instances support two types of database accounts: privileged accounts and standard accounts. The following table describes these account types.

|Account type|Description|
|------------|-----------|
|**Privileged account**|-   You can create and manage privileged accounts by using the ApsaraDB for RDS console or API operations.
-   For an ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instance with local SSDs, you can create only one privileged account. For an ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instance with cloud disks, you can create multiple privileged accounts. A privileged account allows you to manage all standard accounts and databases in an ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instance.
-   A privileged account has more permissions, which allows you to perform more fine-grained management operations. For example, you can grant query permissions on different tables to different users.
-   You can use a privileged account to disconnect any accounts from their authorized databases in your ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instance. |
|**Standard account**|-   You can create and manage standard accounts by using the ApsaraDB for RDS console, API operations, or SQL statements.
-   You can create multiple standard accounts for an ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instance.
-   You must grant permissions on specific databases to a standard account.
-   You cannot use a standard account to create or manage other accounts, nor disconnect other accounts from databases. |

## Precautions

-   Databases within the same instance share all of the resources that belong to the instance. You can create databases, privileged accounts, and standard accounts for an ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instance. You can create as many databases as you want. You can also manage standard accounts and databases by using SQL statements.
-   To migrate data from an on-premises database to an ApsaraDB for RDS instance, you must create a database and an account in the RDS instance. Ensure that the database has the same properties as the on-premises database, and the account of the database has the same permissions as the account of the on-premises database.
-   Use service roles to create accounts and follow the principle of least privilege to assign appropriate read-only and read/write permissions to the accounts. When necessary, you can create multiple database accounts and allow each of them to access only data relevant to their own business tasks. If an account does not need to write data to a database, assign the read-only permissions to the account.
-   To ensure database security, set strong account passwords and change the passwords on a regular basis.
