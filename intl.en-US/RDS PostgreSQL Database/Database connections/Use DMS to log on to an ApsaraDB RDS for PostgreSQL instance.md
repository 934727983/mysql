6.  In the **Login instance** dialog box, enter the username and password of the account that is authorized to manage the database, and click **Login**.

For more information about how to modify the permissions of an account, see [Modify the permissions of a standard account on an ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Account/Account permission/Modify the permissions of a standard account on an ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL instance.md).
