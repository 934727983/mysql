# Log on to an ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instance by using DMS

This topic describes how to log on to an ApsaraDB RDS for PostgreSQL instance by using Data Management \(DMS\).

DMS provides centralized management, including data, schema, and server management, account authorization, security audit, data trends, data tracking, business intelligence \(BI\) charts, and performance trends and optimization.

## Use the new version of DMS to log on to an RDS instance

Prerequisites

1.  Log on to the [DMS console](https://dms.aliyun.com/).

2.  In the left-side navigation pane, select your RDS instance and click **Please login first**.

    **Note:** If your RDS instance uses the **Security Collaboration** control mode, you do not need to enter the username and password of the account that is used for the logon. You can click **Logon-free instance** and double-click the RDS instance to log on to the RDS instance.
