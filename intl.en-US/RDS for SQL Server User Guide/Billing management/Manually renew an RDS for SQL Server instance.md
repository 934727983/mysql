# Manually renew an RDS for SQL Server instance {#concept_fwh_phj_wdb .concept}

This topic describes how to manually renew an RDS for SQL Server instance.

Each subscription-based instance has an expiration date. If an instance is not renewed in time before the instance expires, a service interruption or even data loss may occur. For more information about the impacts, see [Expiration and overdue policy](../intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/Impact of expiration and overdue payment.md).

**Note:** A pay-as-you-go-based instance does not have an expiration date and no renewal is required.

You can manually renew a subscription-based instance before it expires or within 15 days after it expires.
