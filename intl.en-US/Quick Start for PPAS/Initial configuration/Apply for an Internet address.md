# Apply for an Internet address {#concept_nsl_hff_vdb .concept}

RDS provides two types of addresses: intranet address and Internet address.

## Intranet and Internet addresses {#section_x5z_5ff_vdb .section}

|Address|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Intranet address| The intranet address is generated by default.

 Use the intranet address if all of the following conditions are met:

 -   Your application is deployed on an ECS instance.
-   The ECS instance is located in the same region as your RDS instance.
-   The ECS instance has the same [network type](../../../../intl.en-US/User Guide/Instance management/Set network type.md) as your RDS instance.

 We recommend that you use the intranet address to access your RDS instance because this is more secure and delivers optimal performance.|
|Internet address|You need to manually apply for the Internet address. You can also release it anytime. Use the Internet address if you cannot access RDS through the intranet. Specific scenarios are as follows:

 -   An ECS instance accesses your RDS instance but the ECS instance is located in a different region or has a network type different from your RDS instance.
-   A server or computer outside Alibaba Cloud accesses your RDS instance.

 **Note:** 

-   The Internet address and traffic are currently free of charge.
-   Using the Internet address reduces security. Please exercise caution.
-   To ensure high security and performance, we recommend that you migrate your application to an ECS instance that is in the same region and has the same network type as your RDS instance and then use the intranet address.
