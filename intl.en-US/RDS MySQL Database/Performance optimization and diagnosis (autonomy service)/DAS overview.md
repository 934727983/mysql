# DAS overview

Database Autonomy Service \(DAS\) is a cloud service that uses machine learning and expert experience to automate perception, healing, optimization, operations and maintenance \(O&M\), and security for databases. It simplifies database management and eliminates service failures that may be caused by manual operations. This allows you to ensure the stability, security, and efficiency of your database service.

## Features

In ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL, DAS provides the following features:

-   [Diagnostics](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Diagnostics/Diagnostics.md)

    You can diagnose your RDS instance and view the diagnostic results.

-   [Autonomy center](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Diagnostics/Autonomy center.md)

    You can specify a time range and view events such as exception, optimization, and auto scaling over the specified time range. If DAS detects exceptions on crucial metrics, it diagnoses the related sessions, SQL statements, and storage capacity to identify possible causes. DAS also provides optimization or mitigation suggestions. After you confirm the suggestions, DAS implements the suggestions to resolve the exceptions.

-   [Sessions Management](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Diagnostics/Sessions Management.md)

    You can view sessions, collect session statistics, analyze SQL statements, and optimize the execution of SQL statements.

-   [Real-time Monitoring](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Diagnostics/Real-time Monitoring.md)

    You can view the real-time monitoring information of your RDS instance. The monitoring information includes the queries per second \(QPS\), transactions per second \(TPS\), number of connections, and network traffic.

-   [Storage Analysis](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Diagnostics/Storage Analysis.md)

    You can view the storage usage, trend, exceptions, tablespaces, and data spaces of your RDS instance.

-   [Capacity assessment](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Diagnostics/Capacity assessment.md)

    You can view the capacity suggestions, performance capacity, storage usage, and remaining time of your RDS instance. In addition, this feature can use machine learning and capacity algorithms to predict storage usage.

-   [Deadlock analysis](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Diagnostics/Deadlock analysis.md)
-   [Performance insight](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Performance insight.md)

    You can evaluate the loads of your RDS instance and locate the root causes of performance issues. This allows you to improve the stability of your RDS instance.

-   [Dashboard](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Dashboard.md)

    You can view and compare performance trends, customize monitoring dashboards, view exception diagnostic results, and view instance topologies.

-   [Slow Query Logs](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Slow Query Logs.md)

    You can view the trends and statistics of slow queries.

-   [Full SQL statistics](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Full SQL statistics.md)

    You can view and compare the number of execution times, execution duration, and execution duration distribution of each SQL statement over a specific time range. This allows you to identify problem SQL statements.

-   [Report](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Performance optimization and diagnosis (autonomy service)/Report.md)

    This feature supports automatic and manual diagnostics of your RDS instance. In addition, you can view the diagnostic results, such as the instance health, alerts, and slow query logs.
