# Full SQL statistics

In ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL, Database Autonomy Service \(DAS\) provides the full SQL statistics feature. You can view and compare the number of execution times, execution duration, and execution duration distribution of each SQL statement over a specific time range. This allows you to identify problem SQL statements.

-   Your RDS instance runs one of the following MySQL versions and RDS editions:
    -   MySQL 8.0 on RDS High-availability or Enterprise Edition
    -   MySQL 5.7 on RDS High-availability or Enterprise Edition
    -   MySQL 5.6
    -   MySQL 5.5
-   The SQL Explorer feature is enabled for your RDS instance. For more information, see [SQL Explorer](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Audit/SQL Explorer.md).

    **Note:** You can enable the SQL Explorer feature by following the instructions in the ApsaraDB RDS console.


The full SQL statistics feature is provided in two editions based on the SQL Explorer feature: Basic Edition and Professional Edition.

-   If you are using the Trial Edition of SQL Explorer, the full SQL statistics feature is provided in the Basic Edition. In the Basic Edition, you can view only the number of execution times and the execution duration of each SQL statement.
-   If you are using the Paid Edition of SQL Explorer, the full SQL statistics feature is provided in the Professional Edition. The Professional Edition has the following advantages over the Basic Edition:

    -   Optimized data analysis and fast responses to improve user experience
    -   Data comparison and source statistics
    -   Detection of risky SQL statements, SQL injections, and new access sources
