## Billing methods

ApsaraDB RDS supports the following two billing methods.

|Billing method|Description|
|--------------|-----------|
|Subscription|-   A subscription instance is an instance that you subscribe to for a period of time and pay for up front.
-   Subscription billing is more cost-effective than pay-as-you-go billing. Therefore, we recommend that you select subscription billing with a longer commitment. You can receive larger discounts for longer subscription periods.
-   A subscription instance cannot be released within the subscription period.
-   You can switch your RDS instance from subscription billing to pay-as-you-go billing. For more information, see [Switch the billing method from subscription to pay-as-you-go](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Instance Change/Switch the billing method from subscription to pay-as-you-go.md). |
|Pay-as-you-go|-   A pay-as-you-go instance is charged per hour based on your actual resource usage. The hourly fee is calculated based on the instance type that you specified in the purchase order and is deducted accordingly from the balance of your Alibaba Cloud account.
-   We recommend that you select pay-as-you-go billing for short-term use. If you no longer need your pay-as-you-go instance, you can release it to reduce costs.
-   You can switch your RDS instance from pay-as-you-go billing to subscription billing. For more information, see [Switch the billing method from pay-as-you-go to subscription](/intl.en-US/RDS MySQL Database/Instance Change/Switch the billing method from pay-as-you-go to subscription.md). |

## Spending details

For more information about how to view the spending details of an RDS instance, see [View the spending details of an ApsaraDB for RDS instance](/intl.en-US/Purchase Guide/View the spending details of an ApsaraDB for RDS instance.md). The details include the costs and usage that are categorized based on billable items, such as the instance type, performance monitoring, and SQL Explorer \(SQL audit\).

## FAQ

-   Why am I charged additional fees for a subscription RDS instance?

    The fee that you pay when you create a subscription RDS instance only covers the instance and its storage capacity. If you create read-only RDS instances, enable the SQL Explorer \(SQL audit\) or performance monitoring feature, or use more storage than the free quota for backup storage, you must pay the additional fees required. For more information, see [Billable items](#section_prx_qd2_vdb).

-   Will I be charged for a pay-as-you-go RDS instance that I am not using?

    Yes, a pay-as-you-go RDS instance consumes computing and storage resources even if it is not used. Therefore, you are still charged an hourly fee. If you will not use a pay-as-you-go RDS instance for a long period of time, we recommend that you save the required data and then release the instance.

-   Is the inbound and outbound Internet traffic consumed for pay-as-you-go and subscription RDS instances free of charge?

    Yes, all of the inbound and outbound Internet traffic that is consumed for pay-as-you-go and subscription RDS instances is free of charge.
