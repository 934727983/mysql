# Dedicated cluster

An ApsaraDB dedicated cluster consists of multiple hosts such as ECS I2 and X-Dragon. You can run instances on these hosts.

## Features

ApsaraDB for MyBase allows you to manage database instances in batches. You can create multiple dedicated clusters in a region. Each dedicated cluster consists of multiple hosts. Each host supports multiple instances.

ApsaraDB for MyBase offers the following three cluster-level features:

-   Resource scheduling: You can configure an overcommitment ratio for a specific type of resources to maximize resource usage. Resources are categorized into the following types: CPU, memory, storage capacity, input/output operations per second \(IOPS\), and network traffic.
-   Host management: You can use resources of an ApsaraDB for MyBase cluster after you create hosts. You can add and replace hosts in a dedicated cluster.
-   Instance management: You can manage primary instances, secondary instances, read-only instances, and instances that are used to store logs. You can also use instance management features provided by MyBase for RDS.
