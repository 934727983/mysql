# AddTagsToResource

You can call this operation to bind the existing or newly created tags to an instance.

This operation must meet the following requirements:

-   Each tag is composed of a TagKey and a TagValue. The TagKey is required, and the TagValue is optional.
-   The values of TagKey and TagValue cannot start with aliyun.
-   The values of TagKey and TagValue are case-insensitive.
-   The maximum length of TagKey is 64 characters, and the maximum length of TagValue is 128 characters.
-   Each instance can be bound to a maximum of 10 tags. Each of tags bound to the same instance must have a unique TagKey. If you bind a new tag to the instance which has an existing tag, the new tag overwrites the existing tag.

## Debugging

You can use [API Explorer](https://api.aliyun.com/#product=Rds&api=AddTagsToResource) to perform debugging. API Explorer allows you to perform various API operations to simplify API usage. For example, you can retrieve APIs, call APIs, and dynamically generate SDK example code.
